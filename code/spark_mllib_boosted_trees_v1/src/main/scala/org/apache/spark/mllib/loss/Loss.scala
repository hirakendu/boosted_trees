/**
 * Sufficient summary statistics of a (multi-)set of (output) values
 * from which the counts of the values, centroid of the values
 * and variance/impurity of the values w.r.t. the centroid can be computed.
 * Additionally and importantly, the statistics
 * of two sets can be merged/added to find
 * the count, centroid and variance of the union of the two sets.
 * 
 * For square loss, one such list of statistics consists
 * of the count of values, the sum of values, and the sum of
 * squares of values, i.e., the zeroth, first and second moments.
 * This is implemented in [[org.apache.spark.mllib.loss.SquareLossStats]].
 * 
 * Likewise for binary entropy loss and most losses
 * used for binary classification, one such statistics are
 * the count of values and the sum of values.
 * The labels are assumed to be <code>0</code> or <code>1</code>,
 * so that the sum is the number of <code>1</code>'s.
 * This is implemented in [[org.apache.spark.mllib.loss.EntropyLossStats]].
 * 
 * <code>LossStats</code> is used to efficiently calculate
 * the best split of a set of values into two groups,
 * such that each group has low variance/impurity
 * and respective centroids better explain the groups.
 * Furthermore, not all splits are considered,
 * but the values are binned (w.r.t. input values for tree model training),
 * with the bins arranged in a particular order,
 * and only splits between the bins need to be considered.
 * In such scenarios, summary statistics of these bins
 * can be used to calculate the best split in <code>O(B)</code>
 * time in the number of bins <code>B</code>.
 * Such statistics of bins are referred to as the
 * loss statistics histograms due to the additive nature of statistics.
 * See [[org.apache.spark.mllib.loss.Loss]]<code>.splitError</code>
 * for an implementation of this procedure to find the best split.
 * 
 * As a programming convenience for using <code>LossStats</code>
 * in generic implementations of algorithms,
 * new instances of empty, zero-valued statistics can
 * be generated using the factory method <code>zeroStats</code>
 * of an instance of corresponding [[org.apache.spark.mllib.loss.Loss]].

 * These include evaluating the counts of values,
 * their centroid, variance/impurity w.r.t. the centroid
 * from their loss statistics.
 * 
 * To define a concrete loss, one needs to specify
 * both a concrete <code>LossStats</code> and implement
 * the methods for computing the count, centroid
 * and error from the loss statistics.
 * 
 * For square loss commonly used in regression, one such loss statistics are
 * of the count of values, the sum of values, and the sum of
 * squares of values, i.e., the zeroth, first and second moments.
 * This is implemented in [[org.apache.spark.mllib.loss.SquareLossStats]].
 * The centroid is the average, i.e., <code>sum/count</code>
 * and the variance/impurity is the sample variance times the count,
 * i.e., <code>sumSquare - sum * sum / count</code>.
 * This is implemented in [[org.apache.spark.mllib.loss.SquareLoss]].

 * Similarly entropy loss commonly used in (binary) classification
 * is implemented using [[org.apache.spark.mllib.loss.EntropyLossStats]]
