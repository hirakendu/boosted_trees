The well known `auto-mpg`dataset is taken from
[UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Auto+MPG).

Data was processed using the Scala script [uci_to_tsv.scala](uci_to_tsv.scala)
to convert from UCI format to tab separated values, namely to extract the make
from the car model (last field). Header was custom generated.
